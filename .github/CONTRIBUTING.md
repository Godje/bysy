## Just some short contributing requirements

### You have an idea that you want to be realised with this project
ex. "I can add this cool feature to this project"

Before writing any code, expecting a merge in the future, please create an Issue with a feature request first,
discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the feature you are proposing with the rest of the contributors,
and after that you can notify participating contributors (people that conversed on the issue), that you are
going to implement the Feature you are proposing.

### You want to optimize the project.
ex. "Nobody writes Python like this. I have a neat way of optimizing it/cbf-ing it.

Again, write an issue, explain what is wrong, and which way is right, and then you can peacefully begin working
on an optimization. Usually, nobody is against that unless it changes the flow of the tool.

### You want to fix the bug that someone mentioned
ex. "I can fix this thing mentioned in Issue #4"

Check the discussion, and see if anyone is already working it. You can help them, or you can work on the issue
yourself, just make sure to link to in your PR
